Project to a coffee shop at CECyT 12 school


This project I made it at last year (may 2022)

This project is my greatest project programing at the moment :D

If you want to see how works my project, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3k32VjKSYgrJjjHz8">you can see this video</a>

If you want to install the APK, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Hk29SvbisQA2CKS89">you can see this video</a>

Later I'll make changes to do the code simplest and efficientst

# Clone repository
To clone this repository, you need to run this command because the paths are too long
```bash
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

# Add files with Git
To add files in this project with Git, you need to run this command because the paths are too long
```bash
git clone -c core.longpaths=true <repo-url>
```
